- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write clear, concise commit messages

## Code Standards

- Run `ruff check --fix` to resolve linting issues
- Add type hints for function parameters and returns
- Include docstrings for public functions and classes

## Testing

- Run `pytest` before committing
- Ensure all tests pass in CI

## Documentation
