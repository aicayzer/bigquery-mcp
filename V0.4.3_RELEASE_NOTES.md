# BigQuery MCP v0.4.3 Release Summary

## Overview
Version 0.4.3 addresses critical implementation fixes and standardizes the tool interface for better consistency and usability.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed BigQuery Client Location/Region Configuration ✅
- Added `location` property to BigQuery client initialization in `client.py`
- Location is now configurable via `config.yaml` (defaults to EU)
- Added support for `BIGQUERY_LOCATION` environment variable override
- Fixed INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries to use proper region qualifier

### 2. Standardized Parameter Names ✅
The following parameter names have been simplified across all tools:
- `list_tables()`: `dataset_path` → `dataset`
- `analyze_table()`: `table_path` → `table`
- `analyze_columns()`: `table_path` → `table`

### 3. Reorganized Development Tools ✅
- Moved `get_server_info()` and `health_check()` from `server.py` to `tools/development.py`
- Development tools are disabled by default (set `DEVELOPMENT_TOOLS_ENABLED = True` to enable)
- These tools are now clearly marked as development-only and should not be used in production

### 4. Removed Non-Essential Tools ✅
- Removed `get_query_history()` tool completely
- This tool had region configuration issues and was not essential for core functionality

### 5. Cleaned Up Repository ✅
Deleted the following unnecessary files:
- `src/utils/mcp_adapter.py.bak` - backup from failed v0.4.1 approach
- `test_fastmcp.py` - debugging artifact
- `run_test.sh` - debugging artifact

### 6. Updated Configuration ✅
- Added `location` setting to bigquery configuration section in both example and actual config
- Default location is now EU (was US)
- Updated server version to 0.4.3

## Essential vs Development Tools

### Essential Tools (Production Ready)
1. **Discovery Tools**
   - `list_projects()` - List accessible BigQuery projects
   - `list_datasets(project)` - List datasets in a project
   - `list_tables(dataset)` - List tables in a dataset

2. **Analysis Tools**
   - `analyze_table(table)` - Analyze table structure and statistics
   - `analyze_columns(table)` - Deep column profiling with statistics

3. **Execution Tools**
   - `execute_query(query)` - Execute SELECT queries safely
   - `validate_query(query)` - Validate query syntax and estimate costs

### Development Tools (Disabled by Default)
- `get_server_info()` - Server configuration information
- `health_check()` - Test BigQuery connectivity

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the v0.4.3 changes:

1. Test parameter standardization:
   ```python
   # Old way (no longer works):
   # list_tables(dataset_path="project.dataset")
   
   # New way:
   list_tables(dataset="project.dataset")
   ```

2. Verify location configuration:
   - Check that BigQuery client uses EU region by default
   - Test INFORMATION_SCHEMA queries work correctly

3. Confirm development tools are disabled:
   - `get_server_info()` and `health_check()` should return error unless enabled

## Next Steps

### Immediate (v0.4.4)
- Fix SQL generation bugs in `analyze_columns` (complex queries)
- Add comprehensive test suite
- Add docstring examples for each tool

### Near Term (v0.5.0)
- Production readiness improvements
- Docker configuration
- Performance optimization
- Security audit

### Long Term (v1.0.0)
- Final testing and documentation
- Official release
- Package repository publication

## Files Modified in v0.4.3

- `/src/config.py` - Added location configuration
- `/src/client.py` - Added location to BigQuery client initialization
- `/src/tools/discovery.py` - Changed `dataset_path` to `dataset`
- `/src/tools/analysis.py` - Changed `table_path` to `table`
- `/src/tools/execution.py` - Removed `get_query_history`
- `/src/tools/development.py` - New file for development tools
- `/src/server.py` - Removed development tools, added development module import
- `/config/config.yaml` - Added location setting, updated version
- `/config/config.yaml.example` - Added location setting, updated version
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Documented v0.4.3 changes
- `/TASKS.md` - Marked v0.4.3 tasks as completed

## Known Issues to Address in v0.4.4

1. SQL generation in `analyze_columns` still has complex JOIN issues that need simplification
2. Query timeout configuration needs better error handling
3. Test suite needs to be created for all tools
4. Documentation needs examples for each tool
